Refactor TODOS:


- Verify in TagDescriptor if I should use String.replace() instead of String.replaceAll().

- Change LocatorMaker.writeLocator() returning boolean to returning a Locator.
    I prob shouldn't not generate the code in NodeScanner simply because it couldn't write a locator.

- Combine the createLocatorMaker() factory and makeLocator() into one method.

- NameRecorder needs a separate method for writing default names--don't require a null to be passed.  See TagDescriptor line 265
    writeMemberAndMethodNames(memberNameRecorder.makeSymbolName(null));

- Make CodeBucket and HintsBucket consistent.

- TODO:  Change NodeType to an enum and move this to which ever class uses it--probably the PageScanner

- TODO: Add javadoc to Locator and LocatorFactory

Bug fix TODOS:

- BeganWithUnderscore classname when generating from hints.
- Way too long css strings.


Investigate:
- LocatorFactory.makeAttributeLocator()
    // A textless <p> with no attributes returned true but should have returned false.
    // <li>s existed with attributes that can't be used as locators, but doesn't generate a css either.
