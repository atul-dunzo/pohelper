Refactor TODOS:


- Verify in TagDescriptor if I should use String.replace() instead of String.replaceAll().

- Combine the createLocatorMaker() factory and makeLocator() into one method.

- TODO:  Change NodeType to an enum and move this to which ever class uses it--probably the PageScanner

- TODO: Add javadoc to Locator and LocatorFactory

- Reorganize the Notes

- Add a TestException for when the page isn't found.  Currently it gets Unable to locate element
- Rename TestException to PageTesterException

- Rename package testhelper to pagehelper or pageobjecthelper

- Rename package pagerunner to pagetester or pageobjecttester

- Perhaps all package names should have a common root of com.pageobjecthelper

- Configurator needs a review and refactoring--it's gotten really messy and appears buggy.


Bug fix TODOS:
- Rename "BeginWithUnderscore" to BeganWithSpecialChar_[char]_.
- Way too long css strings.
- Should I not generate code in PageScanner simply because it couldn't write a locator?  Currently this is the case.  Am I throwing an exception?
- If no hints are selected, needs to catch this condiontion the HintsScanner and give a graceful error.  Currently it throws an App exception on empty TagDescriptorList.

Investigate:
- LocatorFactory.makeAttributeLocator()
    // A textless <p> with no attributes returned true but should have returned false.
    // <li>s existed with attributes that can't be used as locators, but doesn't generate a css either.


Features:
- Generate the package name from the Configurator's -dest parameter.
