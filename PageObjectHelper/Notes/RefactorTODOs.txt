Refactor TODOS:


- Verify in TagDescriptor if I should use String.replace() instead of String.replaceAll().

- Combine the createLocatorMaker() factory and makeLocator() into one method.

- NameRecorder needs a separate method for writing default names--don't require a null to be passed.  See TagDescriptor line 265
    writeMemberAndMethodNames(memberNameRecorder.makeSymbolName(null));

- Make CodeBucket and HintsBucket consistent.

- TODO:  Change NodeType to an enum and move this to which ever class uses it--probably the PageScanner

- TODO: Add javadoc to Locator and LocatorFactory

- Reorganize the Notes

- Add a TestException for when the page isn't found.  Currently it gets Unable to locate element
- Rename TestException to PageTesterException

- Rename package testhelper to pagehelper or pageobjecthelper

- Rename package pagerunner to pagetester or pageobjecttester

- Perhaps all package names should have a common root of com.pageobjecthelper


Bug fix TODOS:
- BeganWithUnderscore classname when generating from hints.
- Way too long css strings.
- I shouldn't not generate code in NodeScanner simply because it couldn't write a locator.


Investigate:
- LocatorFactory.makeAttributeLocator()
    // A textless <p> with no attributes returned true but should have returned false.
    // <li>s existed with attributes that can't be used as locators, but doesn't generate a css either.


Features:
- Generate the package name from the Configurator's -dest parameter.
