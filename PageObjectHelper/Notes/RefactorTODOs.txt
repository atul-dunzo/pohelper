Refactor TODOS:

Should I remove the HintsAttribute object and use a map?  Or should a make a more general Attribute object and put that in the TagDescriptor also?

Is a HashMap the right way to store attributes?  Seems that I can't iterate through it.


In Locator add the code for turning enums into strings.

Verify in TagDescriptor if I should use String.replace() instead of String.replaceAll().

*** Change LocatorMaker.writeLocator() returning boolean to returning a Locator.
    I prob shouldn't not generate the code in NodeScanner simply because it couldn't write a locator.


In TagDescriptor.writeLocatorString() move the locator validation in to a validate() method in Locator class.
