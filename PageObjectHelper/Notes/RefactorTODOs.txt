Refactor TODOS:


Verify in TagDescriptor if I should use String.replace() instead of String.replaceAll().

*** Change LocatorMaker.writeLocator() returning boolean to returning a Locator.
    I prob shouldn't not generate the code in NodeScanner simply because it couldn't write a locator.



Combine the createLocatorMaker() factory and makeLocator() into one method.


NameRecorder needs a separate method for writing default names--don't require a null to be passed.  See TagDescriptor line 265
    writeMemberAndMethodNames(memberNameRecorder.makeSymbolName(null));



Make CodeBucket and HintsBucket consistent.


Rename the TagSwitcher, it's really a Code Template Switcher.

In LocatorFactory -  change the mult return statements to assignment and then return a returnState variable.

Remove the TagDescriptorList class and just replace it with a standard List<TagDescriptors>.  Less overhead and allows the power of a standard list.

Rename the Exception class.


Fix Bugs:
- Extra blank lines in the code output.
- BeganWithUnderscore classname when generating from hints.
- One line of CNNs generated code not compiling
- Way too long css strings.
