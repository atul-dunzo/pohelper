Install:  (not certain this is completely accurate.  I wrote it a couple of months after I actually did this for Drupal 7)
- Download and install MAMP.  This installs apache and mysql.  Not sure if it installs php also.  Unpack it and install
it in /Applications.
- Run MAMP.  It will let you start up the Apache and MySql servers and allow you to test them.  If you see the MAMP
locally installed page running from localhost this process was successful.
- Download and unzip Drupal.
- Install it under the /Applications/MAMP/htdocs.
- Make sure MAMP is running Apache and MySql (not sure if a restart is required after installing Drupal to htdocs)
- Run the installation script from the browser. It should be found at http://localhost/drupal,
  or http://localhost/drupal/install.php.  You may need to add a port to the URL.  (I used http://localhost:8888/drupal)
- For an explanation of the dialogs see: https://drupal.org/documentation/install/run-script)
